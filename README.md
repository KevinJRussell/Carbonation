# Carbonation
A WebExtension for ETI

Features:
*Alternate Quote style (optional, now working properly and matches user color scheme)
*Blacklist (comes prepopulated with Xeinok)
*'Filter Me' button
*Jump To Last Page button
*Post Numbers

Features I'd like to add:
-Batch Uploader
-Clicking thumbnails to show the full image
-User Highlighting

-Quickpost buttons to add tags: i, b, u, spoiler (if I have to)
-Would be nice if it could work on new posts through livelinks

If you want to help:
Literally anything is fine, I can't guarantee I'll integrate your solution but I can guarantee I won't get pissed if you fork, but these things in particular would be very helpful:
-Fix my broken blacklist, the list itself works but I wanted it to be compatible with both comma separated and comma space separated lists, even better would be an improved interface in Options.html
-Improved Icon/Icon layout
-Improved Options.html layout
