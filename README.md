# Carbonation
A WebExtension for ETI  
Makes a number of QOL changes to ETI forums. Features detailed below.

## Features:
* Alternate Quote style (optional, now working properly and matches user color scheme)
* Batch Uploader
* Blacklist
* Error page
* 'Filter Me' button
* Jump To Last Page button
* Message History option added to top bar
* Post Numbers
* Quick Post style buttons
* TC Indicator
* User Notes

### Features I'd like to add:
- Archive Quotes
- Clicking omitted posts to show the contents
- Clicking thumbnails to show the full image
- User Highlighting

### If you want to help:
Literally anything is fine, I can't guarantee I'll integrate your solution but I can guarantee I won't get pissed if you fork, but these things in particular would be very helpful:
- Expanding Options.html to use individual fields
- Improved Icon/Icon layout
- Improved Options.html layout
